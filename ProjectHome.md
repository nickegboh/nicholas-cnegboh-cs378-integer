Write a program to implement an arbitrary-precision integer and to compute the 20th Mersenne prime.

Implement it such that it works with a vector or deque with each element representing a decimal digit.

The current largest known prime happens to be a Mersenne prime (a prime of the form 2n-1). There are only 47 known Mersenne primes.

There's a SETI-like effort, GIMPS, to find the next one, and the EFF is offering money for finding large ones.
